# #180DaysOfCode


That's my third #100DaysOfCode Challenge. You can find the link to the official site created by [Alex](https://twitter.com/ka11away) for the challenge [here](http://100daysofcode.com/). There's link for the group on [X](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode).
The log for the first is [here](https://github.com/NSokolov114/100DaysOfCode). The second wasn't done formally. Then I moved to Canada and got too busy with the work.

The goal of this challenge is to fill in the gaps by completing one big [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-csharp-masterclass) on C#. I don't know what I don't know, and it turns out that learning things to complete a specific task for work isn't sufficient.

The goal is to study in my free time for 100+ days out of 180. As much as I like perfection, it's not going to happen, with the full-time job and travelling.
