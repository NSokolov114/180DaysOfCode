## About
That's my 2nd iteration of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. You can find the link to the official site created by [Alex](https://twitter.com/ka11away) for the challenge [here](http://100daysofcode.com/). There's link for the group in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode).
While focusing on practicing programming skills I attempt to not to forget on becoming a bit better every day in other aspects of life.
