# List of my ideas for projects


### Game - Hangman

### Game - Match Pairs
Classic Pairs game, but with WoW icons.  
Different classes, different icons.

### Tracking / habit app
An app where you can track how much time did you spend each day on different stuff.  
Maybe with a rulebook and links to extra info.  
A heat map of progress (like on GitHub, but 1 line for tracking 1 habit)  
It's not convenient to track the time of activities on the go on web, so either make it very mobile friendly, on focus on the rulebook aspect.  

### Alloyant periodic table
For material scientists - periodic table where you can click and see which elements do what when added to the steel as an alloyants.  
Simple, but can make it cute and unique - I haven't been able to find something like that.

### Visualisation for all sorting algorithms

### Portfolio website

### Personal Photosite
The idea is to make it simple, but beautiful.
